The Data Analytics group from Good Health Corporation are interested in improving the overall hospital management and minimizing the cost/resources associated with patients’ care. One of the most important outcomes that has a direct effect on these aspects is patient’s length of stay (LoS) in the hospital. Thus, they would like to know which variables are associated with LoS, and ultimately build a predictive model to be used for future visits. The group has contacted you to study this problem and make a recommendation.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
```

#load data set
```{r}
ghproject <- read_excel("~/Documents/BM1/final project/bm1_final_project/GHProject_Dataset.xlsx")

#summary of continuous variable
ghproject %>% 
  select(LOSDays2, Evisit, AgeYear, BMI:FacilityZip) %>% 
  summary() %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  knitr::kable()

#summary of PatientID and VisitID
ghproject %>% 
  distinct(PatientID) %>% 
  count()

ghproject %>% 
  distinct(VisitID) %>% 
  count()


```

One of the most important outcomes that has a direct effect on these aspects is patient’s length of stay (LoS) in the hospital. Thus, they would like to know which variables are associated with LoS, and ultimately build a predictive model to be used for future visits. The group has contacted you to study this problem and make a recommendation.\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n\n#load data set\n```{r}\nghproject <- read_excel(\"~/Documents/BM1/final project/bm1_final_project/GHProject_Dataset.xlsx\")\n\n#summary of continuous variable\nghproject %>% \n  select(LOSDays2, Evisit, AgeYear, BMI:FacilityZip) %>% \n  summary() %>% \n  na.omit() %>% \n  knitr::kable()\n\n#summary of PatientID and VisitID\nghproject %>% \n  distinct(PatientID) %>% \n  count()\n\nghproject %>% \n  distinct(VisitID) %>% \n  count()\n\n```\nThere are 3682 records from 3612 patients\n\n```{r}\n\n```\n\n",
